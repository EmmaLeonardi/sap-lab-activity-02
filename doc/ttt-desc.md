## Tic-Tac-Toe Game Server   

v1.0.0-20251001

It is a toy client-server system implementing some raw functionalities of a Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT) game server. 
 - The system allows for creating and playing multiple independent games. In order to play in games, users must first register to the server.
 - Once registered, they can join and play any ongoing game. 

The system composed by a backend and a frontend

- **Backend**
  - Written in Java, using Vert.x event-loop-based framework. It exposes an HTTP endpoint providing an API to register users, create new games,  join and play a game

    - To run it from the command line:

      `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="ttt_backend.TTTBackendMain"`   

      (to be run from the package root, where `pom.xml` is located)
  
  - Notes about the design and implementation: 
    - `ttt_backend.TTTBackendController` is a big monolitic controller, a reactive event-loop based componend implemented as Vert.x verticle. The controller receives HTTP requests (port `8080`) and processes them. The requests can be: 
      - **to register a new user** to the game server, given its user name. 
        - It generates a unique user id. An hash map `users` is used to keep track of the set of registered users, represented by the class (`ttt_backend.User`. 
        - A simple JSON dbase (`users.json` file) is used to persist the set of registered users. Each time a new user is registered, the dbase is updated. 
      - **to create a new game**. Each game has its own game id and it is represented by the class `ttt_backend.Game`. An hash map `games`Â is used to keep track of the ongoing games.
        - a game has a state: it starts from `WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS` meaning that we are waiting for another player to join, then changing to `PLAYING` when two players joined, up to `FINISHED` when the game is ended.
      - **to join an existing game**, given a game id, a user id and the symbol to be used (cross or circle)
        - when a frontend joins a game, a websocket is created to notify game events
      - **to make a move in a game**, specifying who wants to move (circle or cross) and where to move (x and y coordinates of the game grid, from 0 to 2)
        - each time a new move is made, an game event is generated and notified to the frontends of the two players, through their websockets   
  
  
- **Frontend** 
  - Written as single raw HTML5 page, providing a raw interface to register a new user, to create a new game, to join and play in a game.
    - To run it, open a browser at `http://localhost:8080/public/ttt.html`
  - Notes about the design and implementation: 
    - the page is `ttt.html`, located in `webroot` folder.  
    - the Javascript code makes HTTP requests. A websocket is used to get events, displyed in a text area. 
  - Typical testing scenario, for two players:
    - open two browser windows
    - in first one: create a game (getting `game-1` id), register a new user (getting `user-1` id), join the user (`user-1`) to the game (`game-1`)
    - in second one: register a new user (getting `user-2` id), join the user (`user-2`) to the game (`game-1`)
    - then the two users can play, by making moves. Each time a new move is performed, an event is displayed by each frontend. When the game ends, a corresponding events is displayed.
